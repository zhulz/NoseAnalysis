# NoseAnalysis
I want to reconstruct the inner structure of the nose by a micro camera.  and analysis it on the structure. in details, 
first : --- get the structure of the nose
    i want to get the structure of the nose.
second : --- flow analysis to detect the problem.
    1. though the structure problem can be detected by the an tool, but i want to do flow analysis on this structure to find the air flow problem, and how the structure affect the flow.
third  : make a virtual material support.
    some digital support are draw in the software. thie support is tightly attached on the wall of the nose. do the flow analysis, and choose a proper support structure.
fourth:  make a  real material support
